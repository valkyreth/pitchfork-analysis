Random forests, also known as random decision forests, are a popular ensemble method that
can be used to build predictive models for both classification and regression problems.
Ensemble methods use multiple learning models to gain better predictive results â€” in the case
of a random forest, the model creates an entire forest of random uncorrelated decision trees to
arrive at the best possible answer.</p>
<p>
Decision trees are simple but intuitive models that utilize a top-down approach in which the
root node creates binary splits until a certain criteria is met. This binary splitting of nodes
provides a predicted value based on the interior nodes leading to the terminal (final) nodes.
In a classification context, a decision tree will output a predicted target class for each terminal
node produced. Although intuitive, decision trees have limitations that prevent them from being
useful in machine learning applications.</p>

Random Forest
Random forest aims to reduce the previously mentioned correlation issue by choosing only a
subsample of the feature space at each split. Essentially, it aims to make the trees
de-correlated and prune the trees by setting a stopping criteria for node splits.</p>
