    In statistics, the logistic model (or logit model) is a widely used statistical model that,
    in its basic form, uses a logistic function to model a binary dependent variable; many more complex extensions exist.
    In regression analysis, logistic regression (or logit regression) is estimating the parameters of a logistic model;
    it is a form of binomial regression.

    Multinomial logistic regression is a classification method that generalizes logistic regression to multiclass problems,
    i.e. with more than two possible discrete outcomes. That is, it is a model that is used to predict the
    probabilities of the different possible outcomes of a categorically distributed dependent variable,
    given a set of independent variables (which may be real-valued, binary-valued, categorical-valued, etc.).

    The idea behind MLR, as in many other statistical classification techniques, is to construct a linear
    predictor function that constructs a score from a set of weights that are linearly combined with the explanatory
    variables (features) of a given observation using a dot product: <br>

    where Xi is the vector of explanatory variables describing observation i, Î²k is a vector of weights (or regression coefficients)
    corresponding to outcome k, and score(Xi, k) is the score associated with assigning observation i to category k.
    In discrete choice theory, where observations represent people and outcomes represent choices, the score is considered
    the utility associated with person i choosing outcome k. The predicted outcome is the one with the highest score.
